  abstract  = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract  = {We explore the profitability of day trading Bitcoin futures following diverse consecutive 3 bullish (bearish) one-minute candlesticks and then adopt stop-loss or take-profit only as exits. We reveal that different from our cognition, adopting take-profit strategies would have a notable average positive profit per trade (APPT), which is robust by employing the upward trend out-of-sample data different from the downward trend in-sample data. We infer that such impressive findings might result from temporary rising (falling) prices likely manipulated for appealing to investors pursuing long (short) positions. As a result, investors may realize profit instead of suffering loss frequently by adopting take-profit exits since mean reversion might often occur after such manipulation. Moreover, we argue that stop-loss might be redundant for day trading such futures because stop-loss seems enclosed in the mechanism of day trading.},

  abstract  = {We develop market timing strategies and trading systems to test the intra-day predictive power of Japanese candlesticks at the 5-minute interval on the 30 constituents of the DJIA index. Around a third of the candlestick rules outperform the buy-and-hold strategy at the conservative Bonferroni level. After adjusting for trading costs, however, just a few rules remain profitable. When we correct for data snooping by applying the SSPA test on double-or-out market timing strategies, no single candlestick rule beats the buy-and-hold strategy after transaction costs. We also design fully automated trading systems by combining the best-performing candlestick rules. No evidence of out-performance is found after transaction costs. Although Japanese candlesticks can somewhat predict intra-day returns on large US caps, we show that such predictive power is too limited for active portfolio management to outperform the buy-and-hold strategy when luck, risk, and trading costs are correctly measured.},

  abstract  = {Brownian motion is a continuous-time process that is used to model the uncertainty in the motion of “particles” in different media. The process is named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown who in 1828 observed that a pollen particle suspended in a fluid continually moved randomly on the surface. Einstein (1905) suggested that the movements were due to collisions between the liquid's molecules and the relatively light pollen. Brownian motion can also be thought of as an “infinitesimal random walk” in which smaller and smaller steps over extremely small time intervals, which is how it often arises in many applications. Thus, it can be defined as the limit of a random walk when the time steps and the jump sizes go to zero. Although Brownian motion is everywhere continuous, it is nowhere differentiable because Brownian paths are quite rough. In fact, no matter how small a segment of the path is chosen, you will never find a segment that is a straight line. Thus, a new type of integral called the Ito integral was defined to handle the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the Brownian motion. The process is a fractal because you can zoom in on its sample path under magnification and the jaggedness never seems to smooth out. Brownian motion is used as a building block for models in several disciplines. It has been successfully used to describe thermal noise in electrical circuits, limiting behavior of queueing networks under heavy traffic, population dynamics in biological systems, and economic processes such as stock prices. In this chapter, we discuss different aspects of Brownian motion, including the geometric Brownian motion (GBM), Brownian bridge, fractional Brownian motion (FBM), Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, and SDE.}
