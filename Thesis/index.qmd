# Introduction

## Technical analysis

In his well-known critique of active investment management, Nobel Prize-winning economist Eugene Fama famously remarked:

> "If active managers win, it has to be at the expense of other active managers. And when you add them all up, the returns of active managers have to be literally zero, before costs. Then after costs, it’s a big negative sign [-@fama2014]."

Fama argues that since active managers are essentially trading with one another in the same market, any trader outperforming the market must necessarily be offset by underperformance by another. When adding this all up, the net gains of all active managers before costs should sum to zero. Once fees, transaction costs, and other expenses are taken into account, the overall returns of active managers tend to become negative relative to passive strategies.

This line of reasoning leads to an important and often controversial implication: if active management is, on average, a losing game after costs, then many of the techniques used in active investing---such as technical analysis---may not be as effective as commonly believed. Technical analysis refers to the study and interpretation of past market data, particularly price and volume (the number of transactions), to predict future movements in stock prices [-@kirkpatrick2007]. Despite its widespread use among traders and investors, critics often question its scientific basis and predictive power [-@lu2012].

Eugene Fama's critical views on active investment strategies can be traced back to his influential 1970 paper *"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work"* [-@fama1970]. In this seminal work, Fama systematically reviewed both theoretical models and empirical studies concerning the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). According to the EMH, financial markets are *efficient* in the sense that asset prices fully reflect all available information relevant to a company's value. Fama identified three gradations of market efficiency: weak, semi-strong, and strong. The **weak** form of the EMH asserts that all past trading information, such as historical prices and volumes, is already incorporated into current stock prices. The **semi-strong** form extends this by asserting that all publicly available information---including financial statements, news reports, and earnings announcements---is also reflected in current prices. Finally, the **strong** form of the EMH claims that even private or non-public information is already embedded in stock prices. A direct consequence of the EMH is that active investing in stocks can never consistently beat the passive performance of the market. This calls into question the effectiveness of technical analysis, which relies on patterns in historical market data to forecast future price movements. If markets are indeed efficient in the way Fama describes, then technical analysis would be largely ineffective, since all relevant price information would already be accounted for in current valuations [-@fama1970].

This theory has been challenged by various academics, particularly within the field of behavioral finance [-@teitelbaum2018]. Behavioral finance explores how psychological and emotional factors influence the decisions made by investors and financial analysts. Unlike the traditional assumption of perfectly rational market participants, this discipline acknowledges that humans often make decisions based on intuition, heuristics, and cognitive biases rather than purely logical reasoning. Key psychological influences include overconfidence, loss aversion, herd behavior, and limited self-control, all of which can distort financial decision-making. Traders may also respond not just to market fundamentals, but to the actions of other traders, often indirectly communicated through market movements. This dynamic can lead to collective overreactions, price bubbles, and abrupt corrections [-@duran2006].

Moreover, the diversity of market participants---such as pension funds, hedge funds, retail investors, and market makers---adds another layer of complexity [-@lo2004]. Each group operates under different incentives, constraints, and risk appetites, contributing to heterogeneous behavior in the marketplace. These factors collectively cast doubt on the validity of the EMH. Historical episodes like the Japanese asset bubble of the 1980s and the dot-com bubble around the year 2000 have further fueled skepticism toward the EMH, as such events suggest that markets can remain irrational for extended periods [-@duran2006].

One prominent effort to bridge traditional finance with behavioral perspectives is Andrew Lo’s Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH), introduced in 2004 [-@lo2004]. Lo argues that financial markets are not always efficient, but rather evolve over time, shaped by innovation, competition, and changing environments. According to the AMH, arbitrage opportunities do exist, and active investment strategies can outperform the market, though not in a consistent or predictable manner. Investors, much like biological organisms, must adapt to survive and thrive in ever-changing market conditions. Innovation plays a key role in attaining consistent returns: if the market conditions change, so should your investment strategies [-@lo2004].

## Candlestick patterns

In this thesis, we will take a look at what is possibly the first method of technical analysis to be invented, the method of Japanese Candlesticks [-@nison1991]. *Japanese Candlesticks* are formed by tracking the price of an asset, typically a stock or an index, over a specific time interval. During this interval, four parameters are recorded:

1.  the price at the start of the interval, called the *Open* ($O$),

2.  the highest observed price during the interval, called the *High* ($H$),

3.  the lowest observed price during the interval, called the *Low* ($L$),

4.  the price at the end of the interval, called the *Close* ($C$).

This gives rise to the commonly used acronym *OHLC* data. Typically, also the volume is recorded. A graphical representation of how a candlestick is constructed can be found in \autoref{fig-candlestickconstruction}. The figure illustrates the three key components of a candlestick's "anatomy": the section between the open and close prices is known as the *(real) body*. There are two distinct scenarios here: if the asset's price rises during the time interval, the close will be higher than the open, and the candle’s body is typically colored white. Conversely, if the price falls, the close will be lower than the open, and the body is colored black. It is also possible that the close and the open are very close to each other, which leads to a very small body. This is called a *doji*. The difference between the high and the top of the real body forms the upper shadow, while the difference between the low and the bottom of the real body is referred to as the lower shadow. By repeating this process many time intervals in sequence, one gets an alternative representation of financial data, called a *candlestick chart*. Candlesticks can be defined over any length of time, though some time intervals are more common than others. Daily candles are common among regular investors, whereas shorter intervals, e.g. 5 minute candles are typically used by day (high frequency) traders [-@fock2005].

The candles in a candlestick chart can be grouped into so-called *candlestick patterns*. These patterns vary widely in appearance and are often identified by distinctive, sometimes exotic names, many of which are rooted in Japanese tradition. This cultural influence can be traced back to the origins of candlestick charting, which is believed to have been developed in the 18th century by a Japanese rice trader named Munehisa Honma [-@nison1991]. Examples of candlestick patterns we detect on an arbitrary slice of the "GLD" data set can be found in \autoref{fig-GLDpatterns}. For almost two hundred years, the technique remained largely exclusive to Eastern Asia, where the technique was---and still is---well-known [-@lu2012]. This is also reflected in the scientific literature on candlestick patterns, many studies being authored by Asian researchers. Candlestick patterns were introduced in the Western world in 1991, when Steve Nison published the book "Japanese candlestick charting techniques" [-@nison1991].

```

These candlestick patterns typically feature a prediction of what asset prices are likely to do in the future. This prediction can be either up or down. If a pattern predicts an imminent increase of asset prices, profit could be made by purchasing the asset or index. Similarly, if the prediction is downwards, one could turn a profit by short-selling. This leads to a classification of "buy signals" and "sell signals". Naturally, this raises some questions: Do candlestick patterns actually have any predictive power? Can one make a profit by trading based on these patterns?

We are not the first ones to ask these questions, as there already exists literature regarding this subject. The findings are quite erratic, some authors find negative results for a specific pattern, whereas others find positive results for the exact same pattern. One notable trend in the research is that most studies focus on daily candlesticks, with limited attention given to intraday data. To the best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies have been performed on intraday data. Day et al. [-@day2022] and Fock et al. [-@fock2005] published studies that both omit false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Duvinage et al. [-@duvinage2013] perform a more thorough study, also correcting for data snooping and transaction costs. All these studies only look at a single asset class however.

While much attention has been given to daily candlesticks, we argue that the same level of scrutiny should be applied to the intraday setting, which is wholly different [-@aldridge2017]. After all, high frequency trading (HFT)---which happens exclusively in the intraday setting---accounts for 10--40% of the trades in equities and 10--15% of the trades in commodities. Much of this trading is done automatically through trading algorithms that operate according to a pre-defined strategy. Typically, HFTs trade and compete with each other, and not with long-term investors [-@aldridge2017]. For these reasons, we believe there is still much to be discussed about candlestick in the intraday setting.

The objective of this thesis is to expand upon the previous literature regarding candlestick patterns, and to evaluate their predictive power on intraday market data by making use of formal definitions of candlestick patterns. We shall perform this analysis on multiple asset classes as well as take into account the proper FDR procedures.

## Outline

The remainder of this work is structured as follows. First, in @sec-literature, we shall take a look at the existing literature concerning various aspects of candlestick patterns. This will include definitions, detection and evaluation. We also present the results of different studies. Following this, we explain all of the employed methodology in @sec-methodology. This covers the selection of data sets and the definitions of the patterns that we employ. Further, we discuss our approach regarding detection and calibration. We finish with an explanation of our chosen method of evaluation. The results we obtain are presented and discussed in @sec-results. While we do find statistically significant patterns, that show some measure of predictive power, the edge offered is too small to beat trading costs. This makes trading based off of candlestick patterns not viable economically. Our negative results match the results of previous studies. Finally, the general conclusions and ideas for further research are stated in @sec-conclusion.

## A note about the code {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The code behind this thesis was written in Python and relies heavily on the packages `NumPy` [-@harris2020], `pandas` [-@mckinney2010] [-@pandas2025] and `SciPy` [-@scipy2020]. The code is quite extensive---and the appendix already quite long---so we opted to not include the entire codebase in this thesis. Instead, the code is available (under KU Leuven copyright) on [GitHub](https://github.com/wnotermans/Thesis): [https://github.com/wnotermans/Thesis](https://github.com/wnotermans/Thesis).
