\chapter{Summary}
In this study, we analyze the predictive power of candlestick patterns on intra-day market data. Recent methods, definitions and classifications with respect to the detection and evaluation of such patterns are taken from the literature and employed for this analysis. A performance metric of our own design is introduced as well. Contrary to the negative results of earlier analyses, candlestick patterns that perform statistically better than random chance are found. Further analysis is performed by incorporating additional information along with these candlestick patterns, such as economic news events, technical indicators and periods of high market activity. This additional information is not found to increase the performance. What does impact the performance, is the length of the time interval and the margins used in the stop-loss/take-profit evaluation. Longer time intervals generally perform worse than shorter ones, and larger margins perform better than smaller ones. The latter effect is likely in part due to the effects of inflation, and not purely the result of candlestick pattern performance however.
