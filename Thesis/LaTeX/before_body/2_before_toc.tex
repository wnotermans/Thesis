\chapter{Summary}
In this study, we investigate the predictive power of candlestick patterns using intra-day market data. Drawing from recent advancements in the literature, we adopt contemporary methods, definitions, and classification techniques for the detection and evaluation of these patterns. Additionally, we introduce a novel performance metric to assess the effectiveness of the patterns in our analysis. Our findings reveal that certain candlestick patterns exhibit performance that is statistically significantly better than results obtained through random trading. However, the trading edge provided by these patterns remains too small to be considered profitable in a practical economic context, especially once transaction costs are accounted for.

To further explore the potential of candlestick patterns, we incorporate additional market information, such as trend definitions and periods of heightened market activity, with the goal of improving performance. Despite these efforts, the inclusion of extra data does not yield a noticeable increase in predictive power. In contrast, a key factor that does influence performance is the length of the time interval used to construct the candlesticks. Specifically, longer time intervals tend to result in worse performance compared to shorter ones.
