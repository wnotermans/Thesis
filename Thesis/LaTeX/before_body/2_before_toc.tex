I would also like to thank Prof.~Dr.~T.~Verdonck for being a reader of this thesis. My special thanks go out to Prof.~Dr.~P.~Leoni for the great help, guidance, support and insights he provided me with during the research of this master's thesis. Without him, this thesis would not have been possible. Next, I would also like to thanks my parents, family and friends for their help and support.
