# Preliminary results

## Detection results

When looking at the results of pattern detection, we first note that quite a number of the 103 patterns are detected quite frequently, regardless of the data set. There are some exceptions to this general statement however. First, some patterns, particularly those that require "gaps" between the real bodies, are very rare. This is largely due to the intraday nature of the data we work with. When looking at candles minute-by-minute, the Close of the previous candle is almost always the Open of the next candle, since there is only a gap of a single second between them. Conversely, when working with daily data, this gap spans seventeen and a half hours. This of course allows the prices to shift a lot more than on intraday data, leading to more gaps. The most common sources of gaps between the real bodies on intraday data is due to gaps in the data, either because the data was missing or the market was closed. Because we wish to study the intraday performance and not the overnight one, we filter the candlestick patterns that we detect after a data gap away, which leaves very few instances of patterns with gaps being detected. For an example of such a pattern, see \autoref{fig:window-falling}. Similarly, the same remark applies to candlestick patterns that require a gap between shadows in their definition. Due to the low number of detections of these types of patterns, we will not remark on their performance here. These patterns do not seem very interesting to study in the intraday setting we consider here. A list of these "gapping patterns" can be found in \autoref{tab:gapping-patterns}. These gapping patterns number 35 in total.

Secondly, we find that the patterns detected depend on the data set, or more specifically the asset class of the data set. Just to name an example, the pattern "Stick Sandwich" appears about 5 times as frequent in the stock indices SPY and QQQ as it does in the bond index BND. This behavior will also be reflected later in the evaluation results.

Lastly, there are some patterns that don't require gaps but are nevertheless rarely detected in any data set, regardless of the level of aggregation. These are the patterns with the most stringent conditions for detection. The patterns "Three Stars in the South", "Falling Three Methods" and "Rising Three Methods" almost never appear, likely due to each of them requiring 10 conditions to be satisfied in order to be detected. Lastly, the patterns "Long Black Day" and "Long White Day" are never detected, again likely due to their strict conditions.

## Selected evaluation results

After the previous section, we are now left with 63 different patterns that are detected frequently and are subject to further evaluation. We look at the data sets separately, as the results are quite different among the different asset classes.

### BND

The results of evaluating the candlestick patterns on the BND data set are very one-note. We do not find any significant sell signals, almost all patterns are statistically significant buy signals. Most patterns have winning rates above 55%, some even have winning rates as high as 60% when buying after detection. This result remains true regardless of the level of aggregation that is performed. Most winning rates have $p$-values below 0.001, which indicates strong statistical significance. These results are quite surprising, and definitely bears further investigation.

### GLD

The results of evaluation on the GLD data set are largely the same as for BND: there a quite a few significant buy signals. The number of significant patterns is a bit smaller than BND. There is one important exception: the "New Price Lines" patterns, see also \autoref{fig:new-price-lines}. These patterns signal the reversal of an uptrend, hence they are sell signals. They are made up of 8, 10, 12 or 13 candles that each reach a new High. These patterns are all significant as sell signals at the 5% significance level, for all aggregation levels except the 10 minute one. However, at this level of aggregation the sample size also becomes quite low. The winning rates can be as high as 70%.

\end{figure}

### QQQ

Moving on the stock indices, here we find quite similar results. There are no consistently significant sell signals. There are again quite a number of significant buy signals, however they are much less consistent than in the previous data sets. Curiously, the "New Price Lines" patterns now behave in exactly the opposite manner as in the case of GLD: they are now consistent buy signals, contrary to the theoretical prediction. After combing through the results, we find that the patterns in \autoref{tab:QQQ-buy-signals} act as consistent and significant buy signals.

Four-Line Candles & / \\ \midrule
Five(+)-Line Candles & "8/10/12/13 New Price Lines" \\ \bottomrule
\end{longtable}
\end{center}
```

We remark here that many of these patterns come in groups, some of them being "variations of a theme", others being opposite to each other (e.g. "Bottom"/"Top").

### SPY

The results of SPY are quite similar to those of QQQ. Since these indices both track stock prices, this might not come as a surprise. There are again no consistently significant sell signals. There are quite a few consistently significant buy signals, many being the same as in QQQ. Some exceptions are: "Above the Stomach" is no longer consistently significant. "Deliberation" has become consistently significant. Also, the variations of "New Price Lines" have all lost their significance.

## Preliminary conclusion

With these results, we can make a few early conclusions.

1.  Candlestick patterns appear to possess some level of predictive power.

    Of course, these results have to be taken with a grain of salt, as the methods of defining trends and evaluation used thus far are quite simple. But to see the same patterns consistently having (statistically significant) winning rates far in excess of 50%, regardless of the length of the time interval and data set one looks at, does seem to imply that "there is something here". This "something" definitely bears further investigation, making use of different evaluations, combinations with other technical indicators,... to see if these results hold up.

2.  There are many more significant buy signals then sell signals.

    This is a quite surprising result, as one would expect prices to behave quite randomly on such short time intervals. Long term effects like inflation shouldn't play any role here, so to see that prices are "more likely" to move up than down after specific candlestick patterns warrants a further look.

3.  Some patterns behave "as advertised" in theory. Other patterns behave opposite to the theory.

    With many patterns behaving as buy signals and sell signals being very rare, it is to be expected that mainly the predicted sell signals are wrong.

4.  The level of aggregation doesn't appear to influence the results much.

    The longer the time interval one looks at, the smaller the total data set becomes, which also reduces the sample size of the patterns that are detected. It is interesting to see that the amount of detections of a specific candlestick pattern being detected behaves quite linearly with respect to the length of the time interval. There are almost no cases of sharp declines in this amount from one aggregation level to the next.
