# Literature {#sec-literature}

Scientific literature on candlestick patterns is not very extensive. The two main topics of research are detection of candlestick patterns, and the evaluation of the predictive power of candlestick patterns. When it comes to detection, the research is split in two approaches: a purely logic/rule-based approach and a machine learning-based approach. In recent years, the machine learning approach has gained more traction. As for evaluation, a variety of methodologies have been proposed in the literature, yielding mixed results. Some studies found that candlestick patterns have significant predictive power, while others found no evidence of this.

One of the early studies by Caginalp and Laurent found statistical significance for eight candlestick patterns on the S&P 500 [-@caginalp1998]. Similarly, Goo et al. reported significant average returns for most of the 26 patterns they analyzed using a *stop-loss* strategy on the Taiwanese stock market [-@goo2007]. Shiu and Lu found similar results, also on the Taiwanese market [-@shiu2011]. Day et al. reported positive results using Bitcoin futures [-@day2022]. On the other hand, several studies have found no predictive power. Fock et al. analyzed German futures and bonds, but found no significant returns. They tried to improve their results through the use of additional technical indicators, to no avail [-@fock2005]. Marshall et al. employed a bootstrap methodology, but also found no significant returns [-@marshall2006]. Marshall et al. employed a similar bootstrapping technique on the Japanese market, again producing negative results [-@marshall2008].

With the exception of [-@fock2005] and [-@day2022], all the papers mentioned thus far make use of daily candlesticks, where one candlestick is constructed per trading day. The studies listed above also do not analyze a common set of candlestick patterns, the amount of patterns analyzed varies as well. On top of this, the definitions employed to define these candlestick patterns varies tremendously as well.

As highlighted above, the varied methodologies, patterns analyzed, and definitions of candlestick patterns make it challenging to compare results across studies and draw definitive conclusions about the predictive power of these patterns. Despite these challenges, there have been some attempts at standardization. One such effort is by Hu et al., who formally define 103 distinct candlestick patterns using first-order logic, a framework that will be adopted in this thesis [-@hu2019].

One matter of debate not settled in [-@hu2019], is the classification of candlestick lengths. Many candlestick patterns place (rather vague)   restrictions on the lengths of the candlestick bodies. These are typically nondescript terms like "short", "normal" and "tall". Etschberger et al. provide a rigorous description of these lengths through percentiles, which we will use in this thesis [-@etschberger2006]. Some candlestick patterns also call for specific lengths of the shadows, but for this an adaptation of the aforementioned percentiles can be used.

Various methods have been proposed for evaluating and testing the predictive power of candlestick patterns. One of the most common approaches being a simple buy-and-hold strategy. However, as Fock et al. point out, this method is not an ideal benchmark for short-term time horizons, which typically features frequent trading [-@fock2005]. Instead, they employ a fixed 30-minute holding time and compare the results to those of randomized trading.

More sophisticated methods of evaluation have been proposed as well. For example, Lu et al. make use of a variable holding period, buying when a candlestick pattern signals a buy and selling when an opposite signal is detected. In this thesis, the *stop-loss* method of evaluation employed by Goo et al. will be used [-@goo2007], which will be explained in the following chapter.
