# Literature {#sec-literature}

Scientific literature on candlestick patterns is not very extensive. The two main topics of research are detection of candlestick patterns, and the evaluation of the predictive power of candlestick patterns. When it comes to detection, the research is split in two approaches: a purely logic/rule-based approach and a machine learning-based approach. In recent years, the machine learning approach has gained more traction. As for evaluation, a variety of methodologies have been proposed in the literature, yielding mixed results. Some studies found that candlestick patterns have significant predictive power, while others found no evidence of this.

One of the early studies by Caginalp and Laurent found statistical significance for eight candlestick patterns on the S&P 500 [-@caginalp1998]. Similarly, Goo et al. reported significant average returns for most of the 26 patterns they analyzed using a *stop-loss* strategy on the Taiwanese stock market [-@goo2007]. Shiu and Lu found similar results, also on the Taiwanese market [-@shiu2011]. Day et al. reported positive results using Bitcoin futures [-@day2022]. On the other hand, several studies have found no predictive power. Fock et al. analyzed German futures and bonds, but found no significant returns. They tried to improve their results through the use of additional technical indicators, to no avail [-@fock2005]. Marshall et al. (2006) employed a bootstrap methodology, but also found no significant returns [-@marshall2006]. Marshall et al. (2008) employed a similar bootstrapping technique on the Japanese market, again producing negative results [-@marshall2008]. Duvinage et al. report some predictive power, but find that candlestick patterns do not outperform a buy-and-hold strategy when taking into account luck, risk and trading costs [-@duvinage2013].

With the exception of [-@day2022], [-@duvinage2013] and [-@fock2005], all the papers mentioned thus far make use of daily candlesticks, where one candlestick is constructed per trading day. The studies listed above also do not analyze a common set of candlestick patterns, the amount of patterns analyzed varies as well. On top of this, the definitions employed to define these candlestick patterns varies tremendously. Typically, authors restrict themselves to a single market or asset class.

As highlighted above, the varied methodologies, patterns analyzed, different markets and definitions of candlestick patterns make it challenging to compare results across studies and draw definitive conclusions about the predictive power of these patterns. Despite these challenges, there have been some attempts at standardization. One such effort is by Hu et al., who formally define 103 distinct candlestick patterns using first-order logic, a framework that will be adopted in this thesis [-@hu2019].

One matter of debate not settled in [-@hu2019], is the classification of candlestick lengths. Many candlestick patterns place (rather vague)   restrictions on the lengths of the candlestick bodies. These are typically nondescript terms like "short", "normal" and "tall". Etschberger et al. provide a rigorous description of these lengths through percentiles, which we will use in this thesis [-@etschberger2006]. Some candlestick patterns also call for specific lengths of the shadows, but for this an adaptation of the aforementioned percentiles can be used.

Various methods have been proposed for evaluating and testing the predictive power of candlestick patterns. One of the most common approaches being a simple buy-and-hold strategy. However, as Fock et al. point out, this method is not an ideal benchmark for short-term time horizons, which typically features frequent trading [-@fock2005]. Instead, they employ a fixed 30-minute holding time and compare the results to those of randomized trading.

More sophisticated methods of evaluation have been proposed as well. For example, Lu et al. make use of a variable holding period, buying when a candlestick pattern signals a buy and selling when an opposite signal is detected. In this thesis, the *stop-loss* method of evaluation employed by Goo et al. will be used [-@goo2007], which will be explained in the following chapter.

Up to this point, our discussion has focused exclusively on analyzing market movements that follow the occurrence of known candlestick patterns. This means detecting predefined patterns and then examining how the market behaves afterward. However, an alternative and arguably more data-driven methodology is to reverse this process: instead of beginning with known patterns, one can start by examining actual market movements and then derive new candlestick patterns from them. This inversion of the traditional approach is performed by Goumatianos et al. [-@goumatianos2017], who conduct a large-scale, empirical investigation using high-frequency foreign exchange data. Rather than relying on human-defined patterns, they algorithmically generate over 16,000 new intraday candlestick patterns by systematically analyzing recurring price behaviors.

From this extensive set, they identify 3,518 patterns that manage to predict price direction, at least in the short term. These data-mined patterns are not only novel but also surprisingly effective: some exhibit predictive accuracies as high as 85%. This suggests that there may be latent market structures or behavioral regularities that traditional candlestick taxonomy fails to capture. By letting the data itself define what constitutes a "pattern", their approach opens new avenues for forecasting and challenges the notion that the canonical set of candlestick patterns is sufficient for understanding market dynamics.

Beyond the realm of academic research, there exists a vast array of less scientific literature devoted to candlestick patterns. This includes popular books, websites, blog posts, online courses, and magazine articles, which are often more focused on accessibility and practical application than on methodological rigor. Some of the most widely cited books in this category are authored by Bulkowski [-@bulkowski2012], Morris [-@morris1995], and Nison [-@nison1991]. These works, especially the work of Nison, are foundational in the popularization of candlestick charting among retail traders and technical analysts.

The primary aim of these books is to introduce readers to the fundamentals of technical analysis, with a specific emphasis on candlestick pattern recognition. They typically focus on how to visually identify a wide range of candlestick patterns, what these patterns are believed to indicate about future price action, and how traders might formulate entry and exit strategies based on them. Each pattern is usually accompanied by illustrations and descriptive names (e.g., "morning star", "hanging man").

However, these sources often fall short in terms of analytical rigor. The definitions of patterns tend to be loosely specified, relying on subjective interpretation rather than formal or quantitative criteria. The examples given are usually based on a large stock index, such as the S&P 500, with no attention given to other asset classes. While Bulkowski goes a step further by including performance statistics for various patterns---such as the number of detections and an evaluation ranking---his methodology remains largely opaque. He does not employ statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing or controlling for multiple comparisons. As a result, his rankings of pattern effectiveness, though frequently cited in trading communities, should be interpreted with caution.

In addition to these well-known authors, there is a long list of lesser-known writers and content creators who contribute to the proliferation of candlestick-related material. Much of this content is produced not from a position of scientific inquiry but rather for commercial purposes: promoting trading strategies, selling software packages, or attracting website traffic. While some of this material may offer useful heuristics or trading anecdotes, it generally lacks empirical validation and is susceptible to survivorship bias, cherry-picking, and overfitting.
