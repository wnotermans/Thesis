# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

We can now return to our research question: "Do candlestick patterns have any predictive power on intraday market data?". In short, we find that some of these patterns do indeed possess some predictive ability, performing better than random trading. However, this predictive power is in most cases not statistically significant. While we identify certain patterns that are significant in some cases, their performance tends to fluctuate. A pattern that is significant in one data set may not be in another, even if both data sets belong to the same asset class. Furthermore, varying the parameters used for detection and evaluation can also influence the results.

Curiously, most of the significant patterns we find act as buy signals, they accurately predict that prices will increase. Logically, one might expect this based on long term inflation. However, in our setting, we work with very short time frames---only up to one hour---where one would assume inflation plays no role. This result can likely be tied back to the slightly higher chance of making a profit by buying: on the real world data, randomly buying has about a 52% chance of turning a profit, compared to 48% when selling. This result is more pronounced than on the generated data, where the odds are closer, at about 50.9:49.1.

We also find that the performance---and to a lesser extent the number---of candlestick patterns depends on real world trading action, whether performed by humans or by algorithms. When analyzing randomly generated geometric Brownian motion data, candlestick patterns showed no predictive ability. In contrast, they were much more effective on real-world market data. Our efforts of trying to improve performance were overall negative. Most of the filtering and additional information we incorporated into our analysis, provided inconsistent---and if anything, negative---results. However, we did identify a parameter that had a consistent impact: the length of the time intervals. Shorter time intervals generally performed better than longer ones, at least in terms of adjusted $z$-scores. The excess returns gave a much less clear picture.

Turning our attention to these excess returns: they are all quite low. Most significant patterns only provide an edge between 0.02-0.03%. Using conservative estimates [-@duvinage2013], an edge of at least 0.05% is required to beat trading costs and actually turn a profit. When taking this into account, we did not manage to detect a single candlestick pattern capable of making profits in a realistic scenario. These results match those of [-@duvinage2013].

## Limitations and ideas for further research

This study has several limitations, both in terms of the assumptions made and the methodologies employed. First, although we analyze a variety of datasets---an aspect typically unaddressed in previous research---our primary focus remains on US-based instruments. Specifically, the index BND tracks US government and other bond types, while QQQ and SPY focus on US stocks. This geographic focus may limit the generalizability of our findings to other markets or asset classes.

Second, due to the potential for overlapping candlesticks, the binomial tests used in our analysis are not entirely free of bias. We did attempt to correct for this by employing the conservative Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure, which adjusts for multiple testing and controls the false discovery rate, but the issue may still have some impact on the results.

Another limitation is our relatively minimal use of trading volume, which could serve as an additional informative feature that might improve predictive accuracy. In future work, integrating volume data could potentially offer a more comprehensive view of market dynamics and enhance strategy performance.

Moreover, while the stop-loss and take-profit margins we employed were based on the ATR and adjusted themselves to current market conditions, we did not apply the same level of adaptability to the definitions of candlestick patterns. A more dynamic approach could involve recalibrating pattern definitions based on real-time market behavior or other contextual factors, such as volatility. Additionally, while we used a fivefold block cross-validation technique, a more granular detection approach---such as one based on time of day---could potentially yield more nuanced insights, especially considering that market conditions may vary across different periods within a single day.

Lastly, our use of symmetrical margins for stop-loss and take-profit levels may not be the most optimal. Future research could explore non-symmetrical margins, which might better capture asymmetric risk profiles. In addition, customizing margins on a per-pattern basis, rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach, could further enhance performance and profitability.

Future research could be enriched by incorporating additional methodologies and alternative data sources. One possible avenue is the use of tick-based data, where candlesticks are constructed not according to fixed time intervals, but rather based on a specific number of transactions. This approach could provide a more granular understanding of market dynamics, particularly in high-frequency trading environments, where time-based intervals may not accurately capture the rapid changes occurring in the market. By using tick-based data, researchers could gain deeper insights into market microstructure: the study of the mechanisms and processes behind how trades are executed, price formation and liquidity [-@kissell2014]. Understanding these microstructure elements could be crucial for developing strategies that adapt more effectively to real-time market conditions, as well as for optimizing trading algorithms that operate in fragmented or high-speed markets.

In terms of trend definition, there are several alternative methods that could be explored. For instance, rather than relying on traditional moving averages, a linear regression approach could be employed to directly estimate the underlying trend, potentially reducing lag and improving responsiveness to real-time market movements. This could offer a more direct measure of market direction and help fine-tune trading strategies.

On the evaluation side, numerous alternatives could be explored to assess the performance of candlestick patterns more robustly. For example, building a logistic regression model could allow for the incorporation of multiple factors simultaneously, providing a more holistic view of the predictive power of these patterns. Alternatively, using log-returns---rather than raw price changes---could offer a better understanding of relative price movements, especially when analyzing asset volatility and long-term trends.

Incorporating these alternative methodologies could provide deeper insights into the effectiveness of candlestick patterns and improve the overall performance of trading strategies.
