# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

We can now return to our research question: "Do candlestick patterns have any predictive power on intraday market data?". In short, we find that these types of patterns do indeed possess some predictive ability, performing better than random chance. However, this predictive power isnâ€™t always statistically significant. While we identify certain patterns that are significant in some cases, their performance tends to fluctuate. A pattern that is significant in one data set may not be in another, even if both data sets belong to the same asset class. Furthermore, varying the parameters used for detection and evaluation can also influence the results. That being said, there are patterns that show more consistent results. For example, the "Stick Sandwich" pattern consistently predicts price increases across different data sets and analysis parameters, suggesting it may have some reliable predictive power.

Curiously, most of the significant patterns we find act as buy signals, they accurately predict that prices will increase. Logically, one might expect this based on long term inflation. However, in our setting, we work with very short time frames, only up to one hour. This result is definitely a strange one.

We also find that the performance---and to a lesser extent the number---of candlestick patterns depends on real world trading action, whether performed by humans or by algorithms. When analyzing randomly generated geometric Brownian motion data, candlestick patterns showed no predictive ability. In contrast, they were much more effective on real-world market data.

Our efforts of trying to improve performance were overall negative. Most of the filtering and additional information we incorporated into our analysis, provided inconsistent---and if anything, negative---results. However, we did identify two parameters that had a consistent impact: the stop-loss/take-profit margin settings and the length of the time intervals. Larger margins improved pattern performance, though this may be partly due to inflation effects rather than the patterns themselves. Time intervals, on the other hand, performed best when set to very short periods, typically 1 to 5 minutes.
