# Results {#sec-results}

In this chapter, we present and analyze the results of our evaluation. To assess the impact of various parameters on performance, we use a baseline configuration as a reference point. This baseline is defined as follows:

- Time aggregation: 1-minute intervals up to 15 minutes, followed by 5-minute increments up to 60 minutes (see @sec-signif-buy).
- Trading hours: 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM (market open to close).
- Trend definition: "monotonic".
- Trend averaging method: Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
- Margins: Based on the Average True Range (ATR) (see \autoref{app:C}).

Using this baseline, we systematically vary key parameters to observe their effects. Each parameter is varied in isolation to ensure that changes can be attributed directly to that specific factor. The parameters under investigation include:

- Trend definition methods: we compare alternative approaches such as "counting", "high and low", and "Parabolic SAR" (PSAR).
- Trend averaging methods: the baseline EMA is tested against SMA and WMA.
- Trend inclusion: we test whether including the trend in the definition makes an impact or not; we also test the opposite trend.
- Time filtering: where we isolate to specific time periods (London/New York open, market close).

This structured approach allows us to isolate the contribution of each parameter to overall performance.

When analyzing the results of candlestick pattern detection, we find that the majority of the 309 recognized patterns occur relatively frequently across various data sets. However, the total number of detected patterns varies significantly depending on whether trend direction is included as part of the detection criteria. In particular, when trend direction is not considered, the number of detected patterns tends to be higher. Conversely, when we restrict detection to patterns occurring against the theoretical trend, the total number of matches drops sharply. This relationship is illustrated in \autoref{fig-numberdetectedtrend}. The discrepancy between patterns aligned with the trend and those occurring against it may reflect behavioral differences in how market participants---whether human traders or algorithmic systems---respond to price movements. Interestingly, this variation appears to be symmetrical: the number of detected patterns is similarly affected whether the specified trend is upward or downward. This symmetry suggests that the underlying mechanism influencing pattern frequency is not biased by trend direction, but rather by the presence or absence of the trend itself.

Despite these general patterns, there are notable exceptions. Some candlestick patterns---especially those that require gaps between the real bodies or shadows of consecutive candles---are rarely observed in our data. This is likely in large part due to the intraday nature of the data sets we analyze. As we limit ourselves to time periods within the trading day, where the time between consecutive candles is typically just one second, the Close of one candle almost always matches the Open of the next. As a result, natural gaps rarely occur within regular trading hours. In contrast, daily candle data spans much longer intervals, including periods when the market is closed (overnight), allowing large price changes to occur and gaps to form more naturally. Thus, the rarity of gap-based patterns in our intraday data sets reflects a structural limitation rather than a market anomaly. Additionally, gaps that do appear within intraday data are often the result of missing data or periods when the market is closed (e.g., overnight or during halts), rather than genuine price dislocations. For an example of this kind of pattern, see \autoref{fig-windowfalling}. Because our objective is to study continuous intraday price behavior, we filter out any candlestick patterns that occur immediately after such data gaps. This filtering further reduces the number of detectable gap-based patterns. A similar limitation applies to patterns requiring gaps between the shadows of the candles. Given the fine-grained and continuous nature of intraday price action, such gaps are rare and typically do not satisfy the strict structural criteria necessary for detection.

We also observe that certain candlestick patterns, which do not require gaps between the candles, are nonetheless rarely detected across any data set, regardless of the aggregation level. These patterns typically have the most stringent detection criteria, making them far less likely to occur. For instance, patterns such as “Three Stars in the South” and “Falling Three Methods” almost never appear in our data. The rarity of these patterns is likely due to the fact that each one demands the simultaneous fulfilling of up to ten different conditions, thereby creating a very narrow window for detection. For a visual reference, see \autoref{fig-rarepatterns}.

Turning to our analysis of geometric Brownian motion (GBM) data, we also detect candlestick patterns on the synthetic data. The number of detected patterns is quite similar to the real-world data, with an average of around 230,000 patterns identified across the synthetic data set. In comparison, the real-world data yields slightly more detections, at about 250,000 patterns. Notably, the distribution of detected pattern types is also roughly equivalent across both the real and simulated data sets, suggesting that the generated data exhibits a similar pattern structure to that of real market data, at least from the perspective of candlestick pattern detection.

## Evaluation results

Concerning the evaluation results, one thing is clear: significant candlestick patterns are found. Their amount and their consistency varies however, as we shall see in the next subsections.

\end{figure}
```

In \autoref{fig-buysignals}, we plot significant buy signals across different data sets with varying levels of aggregation. The results clearly show that the number of significant patterns fluctuates quite remarkably. However, there is a noticeable decrease in the number of significant patterns as the time intervals increase in length. During our analysis, we observes upticks at time intervals corresponding to "round" minute numbers, such as 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes. To make the graphs more readable and reduce noise, we will limit the displayed data to 1--15 minute intervals and multiples of five minutes up to one hour. Furthermore, we note that asset indices tend to show fewer significant patterns compared to the other asset classes.

One might have noticed that the GBM data sets are not included in \autoref{fig-buysignals}, as we did not detect a single significant buy pattern, neither in the regular GBM data nor in the version with a positive drift. This result suggests that the significance of candlestick patterns may be dependent on human trading behavior, as we did detect a similar number of candlestick patterns on the GBM data as we did on the real-world data sets. This discrepancy points to the possibility that market participant behavior plays a critical role in the occurrence of significant patterns.

It is also worth noting that we have only discussed **buy** signals in this context. Curiously, we detected almost no significant sell signals across the different data sets. Some significant sell patterns were identified, as shown in \autoref{fig-signifsignals}. One might expect to see more significant buy signals than sell signals due to factors like inflation, but the fact that the significant sell signals are so rare---and primarily confined to short time frames---is unexpected. We did not detect any significant sell patterns in the GBM data, so it’s difficult to make a definitive conclusion about whether inflation or other factors are behind this phenomenon. Nonetheless, we would have expected the markets to behave very erratically on such short time frames, so this result is definitely a curious one.

When examining the adjusted $z$-scores in \autoref{fig-zscoreminutes}, we observe a similar downward trend in performance as we move towards larger time intervals. However, the asset indices QQQ and SPY show some rather pronounced upticks on some of the larger intervals. When we plot the adjusted $z$-score for each data set (\autoref{fig-zscorebase}), it becomes clear that the mean performance of the candlestick patterns remains relatively consistent across the different data sets. This suggests that, despite fluctuations in the number of significant patterns, the overall predictive quality of the detected patterns is fairly stable across various asset classes and time intervals.

Examining the excess returns of significant patterns in \autoref{fig-excess}, we can once again observe quite a bit of variance. This time, there is not really any clear presiding trend. We do observe that the excess returns are far below 0.05%, meaning trading based off of candlestick patterns is not viable economically. Considering the combined excess returns in \autoref{fig-excessbase}, we do not observe any data set with a clearly outlying performance. We do notice some peaks, but not consistently.

### General results

```{=latex}
\begin{table}
\caption{Observed and null win rates.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\label{tbl-winrates}\\ \toprule
Data & Observed win rate & Null win rate \\ \midrule
BND & 0.531\%\pm0.0002\% & 0.521\%\pm0.0003\% \\
GLD & 0.530\%\pm0.0003\% & 0.520\%\pm0.0004\% \\
QQQ & 0.533\%\pm0.0002\% & 0.523\%\pm0.0003\% \\
SPY & 0.532\%\pm0.0003\% & 0.523\%\pm0.0004\% \\
GBM & 0.510\%\pm0.0001\% & 0.509\%\pm0.0001\% \\
GBM (drift) & 0.510\%\pm0.0001\% & 0.509\%\pm0.0001\% \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

When examining the null win rates---those generated by random trading strategies---we find that, on average, buying yields slightly better returns than selling, as shown in \autoref{tbl-winrates}. Notably, both the observed and null win rates are higher for real-world market data than for the synthetically generated data. In particular, when applying candlestick-based trading strategies to data generated by a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model, we observe that their performance is essentially indistinguishable from random trading.

Furthermore, the excess returns obtained from candlestick trading in real market data are minimal---only on the order of 0.01%---which is insufficient to cover typical transaction costs, rendering such strategies unprofitable in practice. Interestingly, we also observe no significant difference between GBM simulations with and without drift. This suggests that inflation or long-term market trends have negligible impact when trading on such short time horizons.

## Effects of parameters

Next, we will analyze the impact of the various parameters on the evaluation results. Since the number of significant buy patterns remains relatively consistent across different parameters, resulting in nearly identical graphs, we will primarily focus on the adjusted $z$-score as the main metric for assessing pattern performance.

Given the large number of plots, we have chosen to highlight only the most relevant or interesting results here. The plots not included here can be found in \autoref{app:A}.

### Trend inclusion

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Images/performance/z_score_trend_GLD.pdf}
   \caption[Effect of trend]{The effect of the considering the correct, no and the opposite trend on the adjusted $z$-score. Considering only the correct trend often performs better than the other options, though there are a lot of exceptions.}
   \label{fig-zscoretrend}
\end{figure}
```

When analyzing the the adjusted $z$-scores of candlestick patterns with respect to the correct, no, or even the opposite trend, we observe that only considering patterns in the correct trend often scores slightly better or at least similar to not including the trend or including the opposite one (\autoref{fig-zscoretrend}). This result is consistent across the different data sets, although there are some peaks in performance when not considering the trend as well. Considering the opposite trend has---with some exceptions---overall a negative effect on the performance. In general, the impact is not that large however.

Turning our attention to the excess returns, we observe that the combined trends have on average an excess return of $0.01\%\pm0.0003\%$. Including the correct trend performs slightly better at $0.011\%\pm0.0007\%$, whereas the opposite trend performs slightly worse at $0.008\%\pm0.0005\%$. The performance of not including the trend ranks between the correct and the opposite trend.

### Trend averaging method

We did not observe any significant differences in results across the various trend-averaging methods. Since the simple moving average (SMA), weighted moving average (WMA), and exponential moving average (EMA) tend to produce similar outcomes when using the same window size $n$, we chose to conserve statistical power by focusing exclusively on the EMA with $n=15$. This choice is further justified by the fact that a 15-period EMA is a commonly used setting among technical traders [-@bulkowski2012], making it a representative benchmark for evaluating the performance of candlestick-based strategies.

### Trend definition method

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Images/performance/z_score_definition_BND.pdf}
   \caption[Effect of trend defining method]{Effect of different trend defining methods on the adjusted $z$-score. We do not observe a clear trend in the performance, the trend defining method does not seem to have too much of an impact.}
   \label{fig-zscoredecision}
\end{figure}
```

Similarly, the choice of trend definition method appears to have little influence on the results, as can be seen in \autoref{fig-zscoredecision}. Performance remains extremely similar across all methods, with no one approach standing out. This result is consistent with the observation that trend inclusion does not notably impact the overall performance of the candlestick patterns.

The excess returns are extremely similar, all being in the neighborhood of $0.01\%\pm0.0002\%$.

### Time of day

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Images/performance/z_score_time_BND.pdf}
   \caption[Effect of moment of day]{Comparing the effect of filtering by time versus the entire day on the adjusted $z$-score. We do not notice a positive effect. If anything, filtering down by time seems to reduce the profitability. An exception to this are the 1-minute intervals, that outperform on either London or New York open.}
   \label{fig-zscoretime}
\end{figure}
```
```{=latex}
\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Images/performance/excess_time_SPY.pdf}
   \caption{Comparing the effect of filtering by time versus the entire day on the excess return. We observe a generally positive effect. The excess returns still stay far below the required 0.05\% to be profitable however.}
   \label{fig-excesstime}
\end{figure}
```

When focusing on popular trading windows---such as market open and close or the New York open---we observe an overall negative impact on the profitability of candlestick patterns, as shown in \autoref{fig-zscoretime}. This decline in performance may be partially explained by the substantially reduced sample size compared to analyzing the entire trading day. With fewer data points available, there are consequently fewer significant patterns detected, which leads to lower scores.

We do observe consistent deviations from this general trend at the 1-minute intervals, particularly around key market openings. Specifically, after the London exchange opens, the adjusted $z$-scores for BND and QQQ are noticeably higher compared to the values observed when considering the entire trading day. A similar effect is evident in the GLD and SPY datasets, though this time it occurs with the opening of the New York Exchange. These exceptions suggest that market openings may introduce temporary changes in volatility or market dynamics that influence the performance of our trading strategies, even at such short intervals.

In terms of excess returns, we observe a modest improvement, as illustrated in \autoref{fig-excesstime}. The excess return increases from a baseline of $0.01\%\pm0.0003\%$ to $0.012\%\pm0.0005\%$. While this improvement is noticeable, it remains too small to overcome typical transaction costs, meaning that the strategy is still unprofitable in practice.
